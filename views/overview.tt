<h2>Overview</h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

     The Dimensional Personality Disorder Assessment is a diagnostic tool 
which is designed to measure the respondant's full spectrum of personality 
traits for those criteria defined as personality disorders according to DSM 
IV. This test does not attempt to determine WHETHER OR NOT the respondant has 
a given personality disorder, but rather to create a multidimensional 
assessment of HOW MUCH OF EACH ONE the respondant has; thus assuming that 
each individual will score at least minutely for each of the personality 
disorders as defined in DSM IV.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

     Since personality disorders are not yet assessed in a dimensional manner 
but rather a categorical manner, several advantages to measuring PD's in a 
dimensional fashion will be highlighted. There are important psycho-social 
consequences to being labeled as having one disorder or another as opposed to 
possessing small amounts of each one, with perhaps larger amounts of some 
than others. Patients who fit the DSM IV criteria for possessing a certain 
personality disorder are currently assumed to all fit into one group together 
both in terms of diagnosis and treatment. However, if patients were assessed 
not on the ground of which personality diorders they display, but rather on 
the grounds of how much of each one they display, this would not only serve 
to individualize the diagnosis and care of each patient, but it would also 
likely uncover thus far hidden correlations between the various levels of 
each personality disorder. In other words, patients would not only be seen as 
more individualized and unique, but it is likely that future treatment 
options will be discovered as a result of research into the correlations 
between varying levels of each personality disorder in any given individual. 
This course would also lead to earlier diagnosis (and perhaps treatment) of 
individuals who have not yet fully developed personality disorders (according 
to DSM IV criteria) because it is likely that correlations between even small 
amounts of any given personality disorder trait will be discovered given a 
dimensional model.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

     The validity of this personality disorder instrument will be 
demonstrated by two criteria:  1) how well personality disorder scores on 
this test correlate to pre-existing individual practitioner diagnoses, and  
2) The correlations that can be demonstrated in sub-disorder levels of each 
(presumed) pathological personality trait, as well as those that can be 
demonstrated in disorder level personality traits (as defined by DSM IV). Any 
correlations between personality traits measured by this instrument may be 
assumed to demonstrate the efficacy of a dimensional model of personality 
disorder assessment, even though the statistical and scientific validity of 
this particular instrument may not yet be demonstrated. 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

     It must be stated here that the author made no attempts to define or 
classify personality disorders outside of the confines of those detailed in 
DSM IV. The author is no particular advocate of the DSM IV model of 
classification, but is merely wishing to ascertain whether a dimensional 
model of assessment will 1) correlate with current diagnostic results, and 2) 
be more useful and informative than a categorical diagnostic approach.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

     In addition to providing a numerical and graphical output relating to 
each respondant's individual scores for each personality disorder, this 
instrument additionally tests for discordance among similarly worded 
questions presented by the respondant. This score is refered to as the 
discord rate and will be measured both according to each individual criteria 
for each disorder, and averaged out for each disorder in general. In other 
words, a person with "narcissistic personality disorder" may be conflicted 
about his/her acceptance of these traits and answer in a discordant manner to 
similarly worded questions (criteria). This test will not only measure the 
rate of discord for each criteria but the overall level of discord for each 
personality disorder as a whole. It is assumed that it is of some importance 
to what degree any given individual is conflicted about admitting to or 
accepting that a given personality trait may or may not apply to him/her. 
This discordance rate till be made available to proctors and practitioners 
who possess the code to unlock this dataset from this instrument.

     It is hoped by the author that this test will be given by individual 
practitioners to their patients and that researchers will attempt to 
demonstrate or criticize it's validity as a scientific and statistical 
instrument. Comments are welcome at the address specified below. Any input or 
criticism of this instrument is welcomed by the authors and by the scientific 
community to which it is dedicated. Thank you.
